Untangled is a library stacked on Om Next that provides much of what is needed to use that library (client parser,
networking, server elements, a database format, clear constructs for data loading). The intention is to provide you
with most of the experience of Om Next with very little of the pain.

## Writing Applications with Untangled

See link:/GettingStarted.adoc[GettingStarted.adoc] to get going.

## See Some Demos

There are a number of demos that show how particular common things are done with Untangled. To view them use
