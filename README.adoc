## Features

The Untangled server library provides a full-stack development experience for Untangled Web applications.
When combined with the client library, you get a number of base features that are useful for most applications:

- An easy-to-use pluggable architecture for adding in databases and other components
- A clear way to add read/write semantics for handling Untangled queries and mutations
- Processing pipeline hooks for pre-processing, post-processing, and non-API routes (e.g. file serving)
- General data compression and file resource cache headers

The overall network plumbing of Untangled includes a number of additional features that assist with some
common patterns needed by most applications:

- JSON+Transit for API encoding
- The ability to elide UI-only bits of query when using a general UI query against a server
- A clean story for app-state merging that includes attribute "stomping" semantics
- Clear network communication ordering to prevent out-of-order execution reasoning
- The ability to send queries in parallel when sequential reads are not necessary for clear reasoning (parallel loading)
- A pluggable ring handler middleware stack for injecting your own middleware as needed.
- Provides access to the underlying https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[stuartsierra component system] for injecting your own components.
- Lets you write your own api routes using a thin wrapper around https://github.com/juxt/bidi[bidi]
- Configurable configuration component that supports: a defaults.edn file, a path to a config edn file for merging into the defaults, and support for environmental variable access.
