# Untangled

Untangled is a library for building full-stack webapps using the Clojure and Clojurescript programming languages.
It leverages Om Next and a number of other libraries to provide a strongly cohesive story that has many 
advantages over techniques, libraries, and frameworks you might have used before.

## Is Untangled for me?

Evaluating tools for doing web development can be a monumental task. Untangled has a particular
class of problems it is trying to address well, and may or may not be a good fit. To help
you evaluate it, you might want to read [Benefits of Untangled](benefits.html),
 [Untangled Evaluation Spreadsheet](evaluation.html),
and [How Untangled Differs from Stock Om Next](vsom-next.html)

## What Does it look Like?

A complete overview is available in the [Getting Started](http://github.com/awkay/untangled/GettingStarted.adoc)
guide.
