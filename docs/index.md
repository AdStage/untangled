# Untangled

Untangled is a library for building full-stack webapps using the Clojure and Clojurescript programming languages.
It leverages Om Next and a number of other libraries to provide a strongly cohesive story that has many 
advantages over techniques, libraries, and frameworks you might have used before.

## Is Untangled for me?

Evaluating tools for doing web development can be a monumental task. Untangled has a particular
class of problems it is trying to address well, and may or may not be a good fit. To help
you evaluate it, you might want to:

- Read about [the benefits of Untangled](benefits.html)
- Use the [Untangled Evaluation Spreadsheet](evaluation.html)
- Understand [how Untangled differs from stock Om Next](vsom-next.html)
- Clone and play with the [Untangled Template](https://github.com/awkay/untangled-template) project.
- Clone and play with an Untangled (full-stack!) [TODOMVC](https://github.com/untangled-web/untangled-todomvc) uses an older version of the library. Needs updating, but still works).

## What Does it look Like?

There is a YouTube video play list of relatively short videos that can help you get
started quickly and are highly recommended.

If you just want to get a quick look of what working in Untangled looks like you might check this one out:

Those who prefer to read should *still* check out the video, but should then
process to a complete overview in the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/awkay/untangled/blob/develop/GettingStarted.adoc)
guide. Those that like videos are encouraged to also read this guide.
