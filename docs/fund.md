# Support Untangled

At the moment Untangled is my full-time endeavor, but that doesn't mean
I am independently wealthy or have no bills. If you find Untangled
useful in what you do, please consider making it possible for
me to continue dedicating a lot of time to the project.

There are a number of ways you can help:

- [Become a Patron or Corporate Sponsor](https://www.patreon.com/untangledfw).
- [Send a one-time Donation](https://paypal.me/untangledfw).
- Hire me for some consulting, training, or as a bounty on a feature: I help via slack for free. Paying me for my time is a great way to support the project.
