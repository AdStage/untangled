# Evaluating Untangled (or web development tools in general)

We understand that it is hard to evaluate tools. Developers spend countless
hours trying to figure out what tool is right for the job at hand.

Untangled brings some great things to the table, but it also has some
costs. When we first decided to develop Untangled, there were a number
of criteria that were important to us, and some we didn't really care
about.

One thing that we found really helpful was a spreadsheet listing out
the various properties that we felt were important. We assigned each
a weight (a simple multiplier) to adjust for relative importance, and
then each developer blindly voted 1-10 on how well they felt a given
tool set would solve the requirement. We averaged those together and
placed the result in the correct place in the spreadsheet.

Here is a link to a spreadsheet you can clone in Google Docs that has
many of the criteria that have a significant advantage/disadvantage
in Untangled. Add other tools you're evaluating, and it can help
you with a head-to-head comparison. Good Luck!

Instructions
1. Log in (and create if needed) to a google account
2. Open the link to the spreadsheet
3. Choose File -> Make a Copy to make an editable copy
4. Read/edit/add/delete the criteria list to match things that are important to you.
5. Assign a weight to each (any number...don't limit it to 10. Something might be so critical as to need a larger number)
6. Put your other candidates across the top (where I've prewritten things like Reagent)
7. Put a score (1-10) under each tool for each criteria
