# Getting Started

Untangled has a number of resources that can get you going.

## Getting Started Instructions

The [Getting Started](https://github.com/awkay/untangled/blob/develop/GettingStarted.adoc) document is a good place to start to see a full-stack application.

## Developer's Guide

The [Developer's Guide](guide.html) is interactive. You can view it online, but you should really clone Untangled itself, and run it via the instructions in the README.

It includes coding exercises and covers most topics in great detail.
It is written in an order that most naturally fits what you'll need to know as you progress in your use of Untangled.

## Video Guides

There is a video series of 5-30 minute videos that cover a good deal of material. I've
tried to focus them tightly into consumable chunks. Use the playlist tool in the
upper corner of the video to see (and jump to) the available videos:

## Talks About Untangled

I've given a few talks on Untangled. Again, use the playlist control at
the top-left of the video to choose what you want to watch.

## API Documentation

Most functions have good doc strings that explain the purpose of the function. Use your IDE's help to see these documentation elements.
