# Documentation

Untangled has documentation in various forms:

## Getting Started Instructions

The [Getting Started](https://github.com/awkay/untangled/blob/develop/GettingStarted.adoc) document is a good place to start to see a full-stack application.

## Developer's Guide

The [Developer's Guide](guide.html) is interactive. You can view it online, but you should really clone Untangled itself, and run it via the instructions in the README.

It includes coding exercises and covers most topics in great detail.
It is written in an order that most naturally fits what you'll need to know as you progress in your use of Untangled.

## API Documentation

Most functions have good doc strings that explain the purpose of the function. Use your IDE's help to see these documentation elements.
