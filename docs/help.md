# Getting Help

If you're just getting started, please be sure you've at least watched a few of the videos and tried
the documentation.

If you're still scratching your head and need someone to talk to, the best place to go
is the [Clojurians Slack Channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/). 

It is possible that someone has already asked your question, so it can be useful to search the 
[Clojurians Slack Archive](https://clojurians-log.clojureverse.org/).
I'd recommend using the following Google Search to find past converations:

```
site:https://clojurians-log.clojureverse.org/untangled WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW
```

that will target your results just to our channel.
