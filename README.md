# Untangled Client

The client library for the Untangled Web framework.

## Usage

There is quite a bit of set-up and we're not yet done with a template. 
We recommend cloning the TodoMVC project or the blank
recipe out of the Untangled Cookbook as a starting point. The TodoMVC
application is already set up as a full-stack application, has
proper dependencies, includes the various cljs builds, is set up
with figwheel, vi/emacs/cursive, testing (client and server), 
and other things.
