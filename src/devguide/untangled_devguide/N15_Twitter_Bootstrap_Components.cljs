  # Active Dropdown Component

  Active dropdowns are Om components with state.

  - `dropdown` - a function that creates a dropdown's state
  - `dropdown-item` - a function that creates an items with a label
  - `ui-dropdown` - renders the dropdown. It requires the dropdown's properties, and allows optional named arguments:
     - `:onSelect` the callback for selection. It is given the selected element's id
     - `:kind` Identical to the `button` `:kind` attribute.

  All labels are run through `tr-unsafe`, so if a translation for the current locale exists it will be used.

  The following Om mutations are are available:

  Close (or open) a specific dropdown by ID:
  ```
  (om/transact! component `[(b/set-dropdown-open {:id :dropdown :open? false})]`)
  ```

  Close dropdowns (globally). Useful for capturing clicks a the root to close dropdowns when the user clicks outside of
  an open dropdown.

  ```
  (om/transact! component `[(b/close-all-dropdowns {})])
  ```

  You can set highlighting on an item in the menu (to mark it as active) with:

  ```
  (om/transact! component `[(b/set-dropdown-item-active {:id :item-id :active? true})])
  ```

  An example usage:

  ```
  (defui DropdownRoot
    static uc/InitialAppState
    (initial-state [this props] {:dropdown (b/dropdown :file \"File\" [(b/dropdown-item :open \"Open\")
                                                                     (b/dropdown-item :close \"Close\")
                                                                     (b/dropdown-divider)
                                                                     (b/dropdown-item :quit \"Quit\")])})

  "# Nav Elements

  These are stateful components that act as tabs. A nav contains one or more `nav-link` or `dropdown`. It reports selections
  through an `onSelect` callback (which will send the ID of the item selected).

  The typical way to embed a nav is using the `nav` constructor in `InitialAppState` at some key, adding `Nav` to the query at
  the same key, and rendering it with `ui-nav`.

  The example below shows these steps:

  For demonstration purposes, we define this simple mutation to record the navigation change:

  ```clojure
  (m/defmutation nav-to [{:keys [page]}]
    (action [{:keys [state]}] (swap! state assoc :current-page page)))
  ```

  Then the following component can display nav and also show the current 'page'.

  "## Combining with Untangled's UI routing

  The above component does nothing more than manage the UI of the tabs. You are still responsible for rendering the
  content of the application. You will likely wish to use the Untangled routing system so that your UI performance stays
  high, and HTML5 routing becomes simpler.

  ### Defining the UI Routing

  First, we'll need some screens to show. We'll just make some placeholders. They'll need to know (and query) their
  screen type:
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source HomeScreen)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source OtherScreen)
  "
  Then we'll need to define an ident that follows the `[type id]` semantic. Since there isn't really an ID, we'll just
  use the keyword `:singleton` for the ID.

  ```clojure
  (ident [this props] [(:screen-type props) :singleton])
  ```

  but this ident function goes with the UI router, which looks like this:

  ```clojure
  (defrouter MainRouter :main-router
    (ident [this props] [(:screen-type props) :singleton])
    :home HomeScreen
    :other OtherScreen)
  ```

  ### Composing the UI Elements

  Composing the UI requires that you query for the correct router and nav subelements, compose in their initial state,
  and render them both. Something like this will work:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source RouterRoot)
  "
  ### Changing the Visible Screen

  This is now a component that can display whichever screen is currently active. The `untangled.client.routing` namespace
  includes a helper functions called `set-route` that can be composed into a mutation to change the current screen of
  a router:

  ```
  (m/defmutation select-tab
    \"Select the given tab\"
    [{:keys [tab]}]
    (action [{:keys [state]}]
      (swap! state routing/set-route :main-router [tab :singleton])))
  ```

  Of course, we could also be using the routing tree mechanisms, which would be similar (though you'd use the
  `update-routing-links` helper then).

  ### Ensuring the Correct Tab is Active

  If you're using something like HTML5 routing, then you'll not only need to make sure the current screen is showing,
  but you'll need to make sure the `Nav` knows which tab to show as active. The bootstrap namespace includes
  an Om mutation for setting the current nav link `set-active-nav-link`, and a helper function `set-active-nav-link*`
  that can be composed into mutations.

  If you're careful to make the IDs of the tabs and screens the same, then you'll be able to ensure lock-step
  updates with that same mutation:

  ```clojure
  (m/defmutation select-tab
    \"Select the given tab\"
    [{:keys [tab]}]
    (action [{:keys [state]}]
      (swap! state (fn [s]
                     (-> s
                       (routing/set-route :main-router [tab :singleton])
                       (b/set-active-nav-link* :main-nav tab))))))
  ```

  The overall technique works the same with routing trees, but in that case you'll need to know what nav links need
  to be updated for a given page and compose those instructions with the `routing/update-routing-links` helper.

  "# Modals

  Modals are stateful Untangled components with app state and queries. They can, of course, be mixed with other
  app state.

  The basic usage is to define your modal in the root, with the various things it should render. If you need
  more than one kind of modal, then you can use a UI router and embed them all in it, then embed the router
  at the root.

  The following code demonstrates all of these techniques.

  ## The general UI Components

  See the comments in the code:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source person-ident)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source DemoPerson)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ui-demoperson)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source PersonEditor)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ui-person-editor)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source PersonModal)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source WarningModal)
  "

  ## The UI Routing

  ```
  (defrouter ModalRouter :modal-router
    ; REMEMBER: The ident determines the type of thing to render (the first element has to be the same
    ; as one of the keywords below). We're treating the id of the modal as the type, since they are singletons,
    ; and the two IDs are :warning-modal and :edit-modal. This means the ident function MUST place one of those
    ; keywords as the first element of the ident it returns.
    (ident [this props] [(-> props :modal :db/id) :singleton])
    :warning-modal WarningModal
    :edit-modal PersonModal)
  ```
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ui-modal-router)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ModalRoot)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source start-person-editor)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source show-warning)
  "## The Mutations

  We define a couple of helper functions that can work on app state to accomplish some tasks we need:

  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source copy-edit-to-name*)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source set-person-to-edit*)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source initialize-edited-name*)
  "

  and this makes the necessary mutations very simple to write (and also a lot more readable):

  ```
  (defmutation save-person
    \"Om mutation: Save a person. Takes the entire person entity as :person\"
    [{:keys [id]}]
    (action [{:keys [state]}]
      (swap! state update-in (person-ident id) copy-edit-to-name*)))


  (defmutation edit-person
    \"Om mutation: Start editing a person.\"
    [{:keys [id]}]
    (action [{:keys [state]}]
      (swap! state (fn [s] (-> s
                             (set-person-to-edit* id)
                             (initialize-edited-name* id))))))

  ```
  ")
